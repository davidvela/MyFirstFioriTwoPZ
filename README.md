For the time being this are the steps I did: 
1. Make my app.view full screen -> 	appWidthLimited: false
2. Adapt my manifest to load the sap.f library! 
3. Add my model.json
4. Add a new master view/controller with the new dynamic page sap.f.DynamicPageHeader
5. Add floating footer!
6. Create Master-Detail-Detail Pattern (with flexible column layout)
7. master-detail last touch - object Page!



-- start learning again and using standard templates
